        <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Qᵘᵃ Quiz collects, uses, and protects your information.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            Qᵘᵃ Quiz is designed to be privacy-friendly. We do not require personal accounts or collect personally identifiable information (PII) such from you directly unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., if you send us an email via our Contact Us page).
        </p>
        <p>
            The app uses your device's <strong>local storage</strong> to save your quiz progress, theme preference, and generated questions for your convenience. This data is stored directly on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data for analytics purposes (e.g., number of quizzes generated, popular topics) to understand how the app is used and to improve its performance and features. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.
        </p>
        <p>
             **Google AdSense**: If and when Google AdSense is integrated, it may collect data to serve personalized advertisements. This typically involves the use of cookies and other tracking technologies by Google and its partners. Please refer to Google's own privacy policy for more details on how they handle data for advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
        <p>
            The information we collect (primarily anonymous usage data and local storage preferences) is used solely for:
            <ul>
                <li>Operating and maintaining Qᵘᵃ Quiz.</li>
                <li>Improving and personalizing the user experience.</li>
                <li>Analyzing app usage to identify trends and enhance features.</li>
                <li>Serving relevant advertisements through Google AdSense (once integrated).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. Anonymous, aggregated data may be shared with trusted third parties for analytical purposes, but this data will never be linked back to your individual identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal processes, protect our rights or property, or ensure the safety of our users or the public.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">

        <h2 id="cookies">Cookie Usage & Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Qᵘᵃ Quiz uses "cookies" and similar technologies (specifically, your browser's local storage) to enhance your experience and provide core app functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>1. What are Cookies and Local Storage?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Small text files placed on your device by websites that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> A feature in web browsers that allows web applications to store data persistently within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, data in local storage is not automatically sent to the server with every HTTP request, making it more efficient for storing larger amounts of client-side data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How Qᵘᵃ Quiz Uses Local Storage (and Cookies)</h3>
        <p>
            Qᵘᵃ Quiz primarily relies on your browser's local storage to save your user preferences and progress directly on your device. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Your chosen theme (light/dark mode).</li>
                <li>The questions generated in your current quiz session.</li>
                <li>Your selected answers and quiz completion status.</li>
                <li>Timer progress for your quiz.</li>
            </ul>
            This data is stored on your device so that when you reload the page or reopen the PWA, your previous session can be restored, providing a seamless experience. We do not access or collect this specific data from your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> When Google AdSense is integrated, it may set its own cookies to serve personalized ads based on your browsing activity. These are third-party cookies and are governed by Google's Privacy Policy. You can often manage these preferences through your browser settings or Google's ad settings.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Your Choices</h3>
        <p>
            Most web browsers allow you to control cookies and local storage through their settings. You can typically set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, or you can choose to block cookies. However, please note that blocking or deleting local storage data may affect the functionality of Qᵘᵃ Quiz, particularly the ability to save your quiz progress and theme preference between sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            By continuing to use Qᵘᵃ Quiz, you consent to our use of local storage and, where applicable, cookies as described in this policy.
        </p>

        <p>
